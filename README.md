🧠 Data Preprocessing (A–Z)

📌 Overview

This repository contains a collection of five Colab notebooks that comprehensively demonstrate every essential step of the Data Preprocessing and Machine Learning workflow — from raw data cleaning to advanced feature engineering and selection.

Each notebook covers a specific stage of data preprocessing, supported by practical code examples and real datasets.


⚠️ Before running the notebooks, please download or clone this repository with the datasets folder included to avoid file path errors.

🚀 Project Objectives

This project demonstrates complete end-to-end preprocessing for Machine Learning workflows, including:

Steps	Description:
1. Data Preprocessing	Importing datasets, understanding structure, and performing initial checks.
2. ML Workflow	Explaining stages of ML pipeline — data preprocessing and feature selection
3. Data Cleaning	Handling missing values, duplicate records, inconsistent formats, and data type conversions.
4. Feature Scaling & Extraction	Standardization, normalization, MinMax scaling, PCA, covariance, and correlation analysis.
5. Feature Engineering & Selection	Creating new features, encoding categorical data, and applying statistical selection techniques.

🧩 Techniques & Methods Used

* Data Inspection & Retrieval
* Duplicate Detection & Removal
* Missing Value Handling
* Outlier Detection & Removal
* Feature Creation & Transformation
* Feature Scaling (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, RobustScaler)
